Conducting research is a complicated process which requires various tools to enhance the efficiency and quality of the work without unnecessary sacrificing precious time in your life. This is a list of tools and tips that I had first-hand experience while I was in doctoral program.    

__Reference management__

- [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) : This is an essential tool to create knowledge by organizing knowledge. I managed to handle more than 2,000 references easily when I was preparing manuscript. It can manage not only papers, but also, website and url to Youtube video. Thus, we can organize related information in single place. It is like a virtual folder for keeping various kinds of data item together.

__Data sources__ 

- Bibliographic database

  - Web of science

- Machine learning

  - [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/): General dataset search engine with various useful metadata of dataset.
  - [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets): Various dataset for validating the performance of machine learning algorithms.
  - [Federal Reserve Economic Data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/): economic dataset 

__Sharing Knowledge__

- [github](https://github.com/): It is not only for source code, but also for sharing text information using _page_ feature. This website is also created using _page_.

__Authoring knowledge__

- [MS Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): It allows us to author documents, Python source codes, and R source codes in a single editing enrivonment.

__Authoring high quality vector graphic__

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/): This tool can manipulate vector graphic using simple user interface to generate high quality graphic arts for academic manuscript.
